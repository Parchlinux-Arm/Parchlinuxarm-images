# Arch Linux ARM Images

[![Build Images](https://github.com/fwcd/archlinux-arm-images/actions/workflows/build-images.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fwcd/archlinux-arm-images/actions/workflows/build-images.yml)

Prebuilt (unofficial) Arch Linux ARM images for several architectures and flavors (vanilla, with some basic utilities installed). These scripts are based on the fantastic work by [andrewboring](https://github.com/andrewboring/alarm-images) and [disconnected.systems](https://disconnected.systems/blog/custom-rpi-image-with-github-travis/#first-stage-script-create-image).
